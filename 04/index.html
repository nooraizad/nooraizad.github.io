    <p>I have completed my Master of Data Science at the University of Malaya (UM). I finished them in 2 years. It was one hell of a journey and a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life. In this post, i would like to share my opinion on the course and whether it is worth recommending. In the first section of this post, I would be giving an overview of the program, and why did I choose to study data science. Then, I would elaborate on things I learn during the course and bits of advice I would give to someone considering moving into data science.</p>

<p> <strong>Overview of the program</strong></p>

<p> This course is offered under the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology. Students are required to complete a total of 42 credit hours with a distribution of 24 credit hours for core courses, 8 credit hours for the elective courses and remaining 10 credit hours for data science research project. This course is a coursework mode program. It is a full-time mode with classes held weekdays from 6 pm to 9 pm. Students are flexible in selecting how many courses they want to take. This courses aimed to equip the student with knowledge and skills of data analysis in terms of big data and methodology in data science.</p>

<p>For each subject, there are 14 weeks of classes, 1 week of revision week and final examination. There are tutorials, quizzes, mid-semester examination and the final examination. However, the arrangement is depending on the lecturer of each course. Students are graded based on the score of carry marks throughout the semester and the score for the final examination. The proportion is usually 60% carry marks and 40% for the final exam. Students are required to score at least a B grade or forced to retake the paper (at the time of writing). The course plan is as below:
 <br />
<br />

<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Elective Subjects (Student are required to choose any 2 subjects from the list below)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel and Distributed Programming</li>
<li>Big Data Applications and Analytics</li>
<li>Network and Security</li>
<li>Numerical Optimization
 <br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why did I choose to study data science</strong><br />
 <br />
I am a mathematics graduate. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of Technology MARA (UiTM) in June 2017. At that time, to be honest, I am not sure what kind of position or role that interests me. During my degree studies, I took accounting courses and also fundamentals of programming in c++ along with core courses being mathematics and statistics related courses such as algebra, calculus, ordinary differential equation, real analysis and mathematical modelling. I have done my internship at Gamuda Berhad in the finance department. With experience obtained during my internship, I am more incline to look into finance and management position.\ 
 <br />
I stumbled upon a job advertising for a graduate in the mathematics field. The company is a multinational company with business in information technology consulting. I applied to the position and after several interview session, finally able to land the job as a programmer analyst. Together with the other 11 graduates, we are the second batch of Malaysian graduate. I am very thankful for his opportunity. With my background in mathematics and statistic, I have been placed in the analytic and information management team. In the first two months of employment, they have provided us with training and classes. This opportunity helped me to learn and understand things I never learn before. For example, SQL, database and data warehousing concept, and soft skills required in the working environment, especially in a client facing environment.<br />
 <br />
After the training program, I have been assigned to a data visualization project for a client in the banking industry. The project duration is about 8 months, and we have been tasked to develop some dashboard to the clients and business users. The tools or software that we used is Tableau. Soon, I developed an interest in big data and data science. I am fascinated by how we can utilize the data that we have and help us make decisions. Data visualization is one of the critical element in data science. Having involved in the project exposed me on communications skills and how we can present our findings to the client and business users. This experience thought me how to deal with business users, how to present my findings and also challenges working in a fast-paced environment.<br />
<br />
Then I started to read on data science and data analytics. It turned out that we are not fully utilize the data that we have around us. There is much application of data analytics ranging from data engineering, data visualization, and sophisticated machine learning. At that time, you can see the terms data science almost everywhere. Companies and organizations are looking into data science as it can help the organization to solve their problem and avoid making the same mistake. Soon, I found out that local universities have started offering their master degree in data science. After some research, I have decided to pursue a master in data science at the University of Malaya.<br />
 <br />
<strong>What did I learn in the course</strong><br />
 <br />
This course covered the students on various data science techniques and methodologies. Principles of Data Science introduce students to the concept of data science, multiple methods, advantages and disadvantages of particular data science techniques and also discussed what is big data as an overview. In Programming for Data Science subjects, students are being introduced to R Programming. Subjects like Data Mining, Data Analytics and Big Data Management discuss techniques dealing with data including but not limited to data cleaning, data storing and algorithms that can be used to process those data. Machine Learning for Data Science teaches the student on the concept of machine learning, from the basic machine learning algorithm to the sophisticated algorithm.</p>

<p>Research Methodology subject helped the student to prepare for their final submission of Data Science Research Project. This subject explores many aspects of research writing, from research methodology, thesis writing and process involves throughout the research project. For elective subjects, I have selected Parallel and Distributed Programming and Big Data Applications and Analytics. Parallel and Distributed Programming is a bit challenging for me. The course required the student to have a basic understanding of computer science. Topics like Parallel and Distributed System Model, Process, Threading and Communication between Process and also Computer Cluster for Scale Computing are very new to me and required extra effort to understand the concept and relates them to data science. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the learning process, and we able to get our hands dirty during the lab session. For instance, we need to set up our own distributed file-sharing system and create a virtual machine on the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>The advice I would give to someone considering moving into data science</strong></p>

<p>I must say that I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot during my time as a student of master of data science. Not only during the class session, but the opportunity to meet professional from different fields is something new. I meet up with fellow coursemate from engineering background, finance, banking, bio-health, software developer and of course, fresh graduates are there too. During group assignment, for instance, we will talk and discuss with each other. Everyone has a different opinion, and it makes the interaction exciting and informative. This is one of the things you can benefit from joining this course. You will have the opportunity to build your network there.\ </p>

<p>We also got the chance to work on different kind of datasets and get the hear opinion from people working in the field related to the domain of the dataset. It&rsquo;s always exciting to listen to a different point of view when starting to analyze or work on a dataset.</p>

<p>If you do not have programming or computer science background, in my opinion, you can still do well in this course. The Introduction to Programming for Data Science course is adequate to introduce students to the basic concept in programming. But I do suggest for the student to work on a personal project related to data science such as data cleaning task, data visualization or machine learning project and get familiar with R or Python. Kaggle is one of the best places to start. There are many datasets you can find there, and you can also browse notebook to get ideas on how to approach a problem.<br />
<br />
Having a background in mathematics, statistics and probability will also help you to excel in this master degree background. Subjects such as Machine Learning for Data Science introduce students to numbers of algorithms. Understand how these algorithm work will help you to explain the concept better and also if you wish to improve and enhance your model when implementing machine learning analysis. I suggest for the student without mathematics and statistics background to do self-learning on these topics. I recommend video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28&amp;list=PLWKjhJtqVAblQe2CCWqV4Zy3LY01Z8aF1&amp;index=5&amp;t=1s">freecodecamp.org</a> that teaches statistics needed in data science. The video is well made and explained every concept in details.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this course provides student on the techniques and skills needed for them to prepare for a role as a data scientist. But I do believe a few things can be improved. I recommend for the university to invite data scientist or data engineer for a talk on their day to day task, how they get into data science and challenges they faced during their work. This can be very helpful to students and give them a bit of overview of how data scientist works in the real world.</p>

<p>I believed time to time other improvements can be made for this course. As the course is still new, students need to be proactive themselves in exploring and learning data science techniques. It would be beneficial to take own initiative and get hands dirty.</p>

<p>I have fun doing this master degree. I got to know new friends and have the opportunity to work alongside them. Lecturers are very helpful and always open to ideas and suggestions. Having completed this program, I learnt so many things and looking forward to applying all these things in my career. </p>
