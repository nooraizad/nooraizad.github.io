    <p>One of my resolution for the year 2021 is to read more books compared to the last year. Last year I think I finished around five books which is a low number. And for most of these books, I did not make any notes or track things that I read. I only did simple highlights of quotes or sentences in the Kindle that might be useful for me in the future. In time those quotes will be forgotten as it is not recorded or archived. It is not productive and wasteful.</p>

<p>Reading while taking notes will help organize the ideas and information that one might obtain while reading. And it will keep you focussed on the storyline or information. Imagine you finish a chapter but then fail to recollect ideas or information. This shows that you are not immersed in the story. The way to avoid this is to highlight and take notes. Then proceed to make a summary of your own. Without taking notes, you will lose interest in the story and later abandon the book. It will be a waste of time and energy. And one will not be able to benefit fully from reading the book.</p>

<p>This year, I intend to track and make notes of every book that I read while reading more books. So I decided to use Notion to record the books that I read and make notes about the book. I used Notion mainly for my tracking and log. I kept my financial planning, calendar, to-do list, and notes there. I intend to use Notion for other aspects of my life and make full use of the capability and functionality of Notion.</p>

<p>While browsing the Notion&rsquo;s gallery template, I found a template made by Ali Abdaal. The template is a reading list. It can track books that you have read and books that you plan to read. You can also keep notes or a summary of the books that you have read. I find this very helpful and well made. As a nerd and productivity enthusiast (lol), I found this very interesting, and without further ado, I copy the template and start using it on my own.</p>

<p>Below is the screenshot of my Notion page:</p>

<p><img src="/static/08_1.png" alt="Main page" /></p>

<p>It is easy and straightforward. You have six columns: the name of the book, category, genres, the author name, date finished, and rating of the book. And for the categorical column, which are category, genres, and rating, I already set few options so that whenever I add a new book to the list, I can pick from one of the options and save it. It is similar to the one shared by Ali. I believed all these columns are sufficient if one would like to have an overview of the books that have already been read.</p>

<p>When clicking on the &lsquo;Open as page&rsquo; option, it will be prompt a page to write notes of the books that I have read. For example, the below screenshot shows the review of a book, Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&rsquo;re Wrong About the World. There are few sections on the page, but it is not fixed for every book. Those sections will be The Book in 3 Sentences, Impressions, Who Should Read It, How the Book Change Me, and Top 3 Quotes. So by having all these different sections, it is easy for me to outline my thoughts and ideas based on the book. But from time to time, there may be additional sections that I think can be beneficial to me whenever I go through this page again.</p>

<p><img src="/static/08_2.png" alt="Expanded" /></p>

<p>These are the tool that I used to keep track of my reading. I have to admit I am quite a slow reader, but I want to read as much as I can this year and get the values from the books that I readâ€”and using Notion as the tool is life-changing, in my opinion. I believe it is very systematic for me now, and I should stick to this system and have fun reading and taking notes.</p>

<p>Until next time, cheers!</p>
