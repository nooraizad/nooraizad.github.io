<h1 id="the-book-in-3-sentences">üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences</h1>

<ul>
<li>In this book, the author explored ten different instincts on how we access a situation or condition that we are going through.</li>
<li>Hans Rosling, the author, was a world-renowned public speaker, physician, and academician and best known for using various data visualization techniques to explore world development issues.</li>
<li>Must-read non-fiction simply because the author busts myths using facts and made the readers appreciate fact-checking on any news or articles they read.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="impressions">üé® Impressions</h1>

<p>I got to know this book from an article on books recommended by Bill Gates. This article is based on his tweet where he mentioned how four books made him feel optimistic about the world and how innovation is driving humanity to a different level. He even wrote an article solely about this book and claimed how this book is one of the most educational books he even read.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1050029053946843142?s=20">Bill Gates on Twitter: &ldquo;I just shared a new list on @Likewise. These books make me optimistic about the world and help me understand the role of innovation in driving progress. https://t.co/SVqGlLdBUp / Twitter&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>There is no particular reason why I decided to read this book compared to the other books. But the title should strike you as something that is needed to be read right away. With the pandemic that we are in right now, we should be careful about reading and analyzing articles or news from a different perspective.</p>

<p>The title itself: &ldquo;Why things are better than you think,&rdquo; made you want to dive into the book and see how the author presented his ideas on this world is a better place than most of us think. Honestly, I think the author does not oversell this idea. After you read this book, your perspective changes, and you will appreciate things around you more.</p>

<h1 id="who-should-read-it">üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who Should Read It?</h1>

<p>Everyone! The aim of the book is essential to fight ignorance and over-dramatic, especially in journalism and social media. By applying techniques and tools presented by the author, a reader can see things differently. For instance, in Chapter 4: The Fear Instinct, the author discussed how fear plays a tricky game on our minds when we are going through a horrifying moment. When we are afraid, we tend to see things worse than they appear to be.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-book-changed-me">‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me</h1>

<ul>
<li>In each chapter, the author elaborated on how these instincts made us see things from the wrong perspective and how we should be careful in making any assessments.</li>
<li>This book changed how I perceived news, articles, or posts from social media. This book illustrates how myths hindered our human development and how we cannot add values to our life due to skewed perceptions.</li>
<li>After reading this book, I try to be extra careful when I share or retweet any posts on Facebook or Twitter. I got to admit I was passionate about sharing things in the past. The prospect of checking the facts first before sharing never occurred to me before, which I need to work on.</li>
<li>On another exciting note, the author never judges people on their misconception. He never blames people for having skewed perceptions, and he avoids picking a fight with the media. Instead, he relates to his own experience of how he made a wrong decision that almost causes danger in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="my-top-3-quotes">‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes</h1>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Look for causes, not villians&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Remember: things can be bad, and getting better&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
