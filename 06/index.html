    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog. It has been some time since my last post. I have been busy with life and works and have become lazy and unmotivated to write new articles. So for this year, I will try to write as much as I can. I set a goal of posting a blog once a week. I want to make myself accountable for this. I want to improve my writing and share my opinions and thoughts on things that I follow and care about. So let us start with something personal and close to me.</p>

<p>One day while browsing YouTube, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeG-gurn75I&amp;t=71s">video</a> from CNBC Make It channel. The video discussed how having kids would have an impact on a couple&rsquo;s happiness and well-being. The main takeaway that I got from this video is that having kids will have the up and down; in comparison to being a parent without kids, life is stable and predictable, but it may become stale and boring at one time. For parents with children, having to see them grow is a kind of satisfaction. In contrast to parents without children, the cost of having and raising children is something that they are not willing to commit. So this video illustrates arguments and points from both points of view.</p>

<p>Now that my daughter has almost one year, I would like to share my thoughts and feelings on this matter. Having children or kids opens your eyes to new perspectives, and I feel like these things only can be learned until you have your kids. The feeling is the same when you hold your baby for the first time. No words can explain you&rsquo;re true feeling at that time. I was thinking about what in the world I did to deserve this pure and sweet small creature. I don&rsquo;t have the answer. Why my daughter chose me to be his father and the reason God sent her to me is the thought that I cannot get out of my head until now. When you look into their eyes, you can feel the warmth and the love. It is a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>Having kids also makes me appreciate my wife and my mother more. So there&rsquo;s debate around if maternal instinct is a myth. Maternal instinct is defined as an innate knowledge and set of caregiving behaviors that are an automatic part of becoming and being a mother. Its meaning woman when they have their babies, these characteristics will automatically be reflected. Without proper class or teaching, they can feed their babies, comfort them, and make sure they can sleep at night. I can see her maternal instinct for my wife&rsquo;s case when our daughter was born into the world.</p>

<p>I am amazed watching my wife being a mother. She is so patient, hardworking, and loving. All the sleepless nights and the effort she poured into taking care of our daughter are something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. It reminds me of my parents, and immediately I feel overwhelmed imagining they taking care of me when I was a baby. Like I mentioned before, the birth of my daughter open my eyes to a new perspective and make me appreciate more things I did not appreciate enough back.</p>

<p>I try to help my wife as much as I can. I take care of most of the household chores. In feeding our daughter especially, there is not much I can contribute. But I try to give my wife healthy and nutritious meals to feed our baby and support her in her breastfeeding journey. It is tiring for her, I can see from her face, but she never whines or grumble. I am so thankful for that. And I want to remind my daughter in the future of how her mum sacrificed so much for her.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe having kids makes one happier, but it teaches values and lessons that are not available anywhere else. It is a tiring journey, especially when your children are still babies. I believe the benefits outweigh all this. It made me realized things I may overlook before. But I do understand why some couples chose not to have kids; it depends on many factors. And for those who long for their kids and have been trying for some time, my thoughts and prays for them, always. Keep trying and have hope. Enjoy your time as a couple and keep making memories together.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
